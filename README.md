# PURPOSE
* The purpose of this notebook is to compare OLS regression to XGBoost fitted to non-linear data.  It is acknowledged that the models are only fit on training data since the point of this notebook is to look at metrics that indicate the models can learn from the data rather than test predictive ability or assess bias and variance.
